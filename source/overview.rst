Overview
########

**COOPER** is a flexible sensor platform for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. It has been designed to meet the highest quality standards for environmental monitoring, low-power operation from batteries and wireless communication. Customized sensor and firmware configuration is available on request including silicone strap color customization, logo printing (using colored UV printing technology) and high-speed CNC milling in the top cover. The device is powered from 3x AA Alkaline 1.5V cells and it can provide up to 3 years of service time from the battery installation. Service time is given by the sensor measurement frequency, chosen communication technology, and communication interval.
